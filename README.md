## TIPS

Use target attribute to open url links in new tabs.

```<a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools.com!</a> ```


When working with PDFs, you can use the same target attribute to open PDF in a new tab.
```<a href="steve.pdf" target="_blank">Open PDF in new tab.</a>```

Alternatively, you can use an iframe inside modal window to view PDF or convert the PDF to a .jpg or .png file.
